# Application: Sklearn Diabetes Prediction

## Overview
This project involves a web application that predicts diabetes based on user inputs. Users can input various health metrics such as Age, Sex, BMI, Blood Pressure (BP), and Cholesterol levels. The application leverages a Machine Learning regression model built with the scikit-learn library, utilizing its diabetes dataset.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Allows easy input of health metrics through a web form.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Utilizes a regression model to predict diabetes risk based on input data.
- **Deployment:** Deployed on Microsoft Azure cloud services, ensuring scalable and robust access.

## Technologies Used
- **scikit-learn** for building and training the regression model.
- **Flask** for backend development, serving the application, and interfacing with the frontend.
- **HTML/CSS** for frontend development, providing a clean and responsive user interface.
- **Microsoft Azure** for deploying the application using a Resource Group and an App Service Plan.

## Deployment on Azure

To deploy this application on Microsoft Azure, follow the detailed steps provided in the Azure documentation for setting up a Resource Group, App Service Plan, and deploying a Flask application. Ensure that your Azure environment variables and settings are correctly configured to manage the deployment successfully.
